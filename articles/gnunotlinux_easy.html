      <h2>Short Version</h2>
      <p>
        Many people say “Linux” when they talk about their operating system.
        But this is not fully correct. The system most people use is called
        <strong>GNU/Linux</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Linux is only one small part. GNU is the bigger part.
      </p>

      <h2>What is GNU?</h2>
      <p>
        GNU is an operating system. It includes the programs you use every day:
        the shell, basic commands, system tools, and many important parts.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you type commands, start programs, or use a terminal, you are
        using GNU.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
      <p>
        Linux is the <strong>kernel</strong>. The kernel is the core of the system.
        It talks to the hardware, like the CPU, memory, disks, and network.
      </p>

      <p>
        The kernel works in the background. You normally do not interact with it
        directly.
      </p>

      <h2>Why the Name Matters</h2>
      <p>
        We name systems after what we actually use.
      </p>

      <ul class="post-list">
        <li>We say “Windows”, not “NT”.</li>
        <li>We say “macOS”, not “Darwin”.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In the same way, calling GNU/Linux just “Linux” ignores most of the system.
      </p>

      <h2>About Credit</h2>
      <p>
        The GNU Project started long before Linux existed.
        Richard Stallman and many others worked for years to build a free
        operating system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Linux was the missing piece: the kernel.
        But GNU was already there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Calling the system only “Linux” gives credit to the kernel,
        but not to the GNU Project, even though GNU is the bigger part.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Linux is important, but it is not the whole system.
      </p>

      <p>
        The correct and fair name is <strong>GNU/Linux</strong>.
        If you want a short name, <strong>GNU</strong> would actually be
        more correct than “Linux”.
      </p>
