          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            Factually: it&rsquo;s GNU/Linux or GNU+Linux.
            GNU is the operating system and userland, Linux is the Kernel. We call Windows
            &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; because that is the operating system; NT is the Windows Kernel.
            We call macOS &ldquo;macOS&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s the operating system, not the
            Xen/Darwin Kernel. Linux is a component in a fully functional GNU Operating System.
            If you want to leave any part out of &ldquo;GNU+Linux&rdquo;, logically you should
            leave out the Linux part. Because GNU is the operating system. Windows is the operating
            system, not NT. macOS is the operating system, not Xen/Darwin. Calling GNU+Linux just
            &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; strips the GNU Project and Stallman&rsquo;s efforts of credit,
            falsely gives Torvalds all the credit, even though he just made the last missing piece
            to the GNU operating system, and ignores the fact that Linux is just a Kernel, not an
            operating system.
          </p>

          <p>
            You do not use just Linux. A kernel allocates resources to applications and manages
            most of the hardware interactions and other stuff to be managed. What you actually
            interact with is the operating system: the GNU operating system. If you do not use GNU
            and maybe something like busybox, then you&rsquo;d be using busybox+Linux, or just
            busybox.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fact that Linux was not initially developed for the GNU system does not mean it is
            the biggest, most important, most credible, or most notable part of the GNU operating
            system. You say Windows too, don&rsquo;t you? Not &ldquo;NT&rdquo;. Because you name
            what you interact with. You rarely interact directly with the Kernel. The kernel is
            just a component of the GNU operating system.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can&rsquo;t randomly give Linux more credit and leave out all of Stallman&rsquo;s
            and the GNU Project&rsquo;s work just for convenience sake.
          </p>

          <h2>Breakdown</h2>

          <h3>Factual Side</h3>
          <p>
            Linux is one component of a complete GNU operating system. Reducing the entire
            operating system to its Kernel is the same as calling &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; NT &mdash;
            it&rsquo;s not true. NT is a part of a Windows OS; Linux is a part of a GNU OS.
          </p>

          <h3>Accuracy</h3>
          <p>
            As stated before, Linux, the Kernel, is part of the GNU operating system. Linux itself
            without the GNU (or any other top-level) operating system is mostly unusable.
          </p>

          <h3>Ethics</h3>
          <p>
            By reducing GNU+Linux to &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; you strip all the credit away from the
            GNU Project and Richard Stallman who developed the GNU Project way before Linux was
            even an idea. GNU is the largest part of a fully functioning GNU+Linux system. If you
            want to leave out any part for convenience sake, you should leave out the
            &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; part, just like you do with Windows or macOS. Do you call Windows
            &ldquo;NT&rdquo;? No. Do you call macOS &ldquo;Xen/Darwin&rdquo;? No. Calling
            GNU+Linux (or just GNU) simply &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; is disrespectful, inaccurate,
            strips Stallman of all credit, and ignores the biggest part that makes GNU+Linux
            functional. Which is the GNU operating system.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Want a short and easy to pronounce name? &ldquo;GNU&rdquo; would be factually more
            correct than &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. GNU defines the OS goals, GNU predates the Kernel,
            GNU supplies the system identity, the Kernel is an implementation detail, GNU provides
            the shells, userland, init-system (originally at least), coreutils, and basically
            everything you interact with, rely on, use on a daily basis, and call &ldquo;the
            Operating System&rdquo;.
